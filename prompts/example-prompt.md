## Best Practices for Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include the type of application, key features, and target audience
2. **Mention Context**: Specify the technology stack or domain when relevant
3. **Include Scope**: Define what should be covered (installation, usage, examples, etc.)
4. **Set Tone**: Mention if you want formal, friendly, or technical documentation
5. **Specify Length**: Indicate if you need brief overview or comprehensive guide

## Template Variables

You can use these patterns in your prompts:
- `[APPLICATION_TYPE]` - e.g., "web application", "mobile app", "API service"
- `[KEY_FEATURES]` - e.g., "user authentication, data visualization, real-time updates"
- `[TECHNOLOGY_STACK]` - e.g., "React and Node.js", "Python Flask", "Java Spring"
- `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]` - e.g., "developers", "end users", "system administrators"
